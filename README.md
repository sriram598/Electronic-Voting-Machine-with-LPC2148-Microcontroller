# Electronic Voting Machine using LPC2148 Microcontroller

This project implements a simple and secure **electronic voting system** using the **LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller**.  
Candidate names are displayed on a 16x2 LCD, and voters cast their votes using push buttons.  
The system records each vote, counts the totals, and displays the final winner.

- **16x2 LCD** for displaying candidates and results  
- **Push buttons** for casting votes  
- **LED indicator** for ‚ÄúVoted‚Äù status  
- Displays the winning candidate on the LCD screen

##  Working Principle
1. The system initializes and displays candidate names on the LCD.  
2. Voter presses a push button to select their candidate.  
3. The vote is recorded and the ‚ÄúVoted‚Äù LED turns ON.  
4. Once voting is complete, the system displays total votes and the winning candidate.
