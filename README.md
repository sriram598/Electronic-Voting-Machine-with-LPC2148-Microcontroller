# Electronic-Voting-Machine-with-LPC2148-Microcontroller
This project uses the LPC2148 microcontroller to create a simple and secure electronic voting system. Candidate names are shown on an LCD, and voters can cast their votes using push buttons. The system automatically records each vote, tallies the total count, and displays the final winner.
